# MVP Story: Email Digest System

## üéØ **Story Overview**

**Status: ‚úÖ APPROVED**

**As a** user,
**I want** to send email digests with video summaries
**so that** I can share curated content with myself or others.

## üìã **Acceptance Criteria**

### **Given** a user is on the dashboard with selected channels and videos
### **When** they click the "Send Digest" button
### **Then** they should:
- [ ] See a "Send Digest" button prominently displayed on the dashboard

- [x] Create digest run records in database
- [x] **Unit Test**: Test digest generation with mock video data

### **Task 3: Email Template System (AC: 3, 4)**
- [x] Design HTML email templates with video thumbnails and summaries
- [x] Create text fallback templates for email clients
- [x] Include digest web view URL in email template
- [x] Add branding and responsive styling
- [x] **Unit Test**: Test template rendering with various video data

### **Task 4: Frontend Integration (AC: 1, 2)**
- [x] Add "Send Digest" button to dashboard (prominent placement)
- [x] Implement email sending functionality via API

- [x] Create email preferences interface in user settings
- [x] **Unit Test**: Test dashboard button and notification components

### **Task 5: API Endpoints (AC: 2, 3)**
- [x] Create `POST /digests/run` endpoint for manual digest sending (aligns with architecture)
- [x] Create `GET /digests/latest` endpoint for latest digest metadata
- [x] Create `GET /digests/:id` endpoint for web view access
- [x] Implement email preferences endpoints
- [x] **API Test**: Test digest sending and retrieval endpoints

### **Task 6: Database Integration (AC: 3)**
- [x] Implement digest_run table operations (create, update status)
- [x] Implement digest_item table for video associations
- [x] Add email delivery tracking fields
- [x] Create database migrations for digest tables
- [x] **Integration Test**: Test database operations with real data

## üìä **Definition of Done**

- [x] "Send Digest" button is visible and functional on dashboard
- [x] Email service is configured and working (development/production)
- [x] Digest emails are delivered successfully with video content
- [x] Email templates render correctly across major email clients
- [x] User can manage email preferences (frequency, template style)
- [x] Error handling for email failures with user feedback
- [x] Digest web view is accessible via signed URLs
- [x] All tests are passing (unit, integration, API)

## üéØ **Success Metrics**

- [ ] Email delivery success rate > 95%
- [ ] Digest generation completes within 30 seconds
- [ ] Email templates render correctly across email clients
- [ ] User can send digest with one click
- [ ] Email preferences are saved and applied correctly

## üîó **Dependencies**

- Enhanced Dashboard with Channel Management (‚úÖ Complete)
- Video summary generation (AI integration) - from previous stories
- User authentication and channel selection (‚úÖ Complete)

## üìù **Notes**

This is the **final step** in the MVP user flow. The email digest system provides the core value proposition - users can easily share curated video content via email. This feature completes the MVP and delivers the main user benefit.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Dev Notes**

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 2 successfully implemented enhanced dashboard with channel management
- React Query integration proven effective for data management
- Ant Design components provide excellent UX foundation
- All backend tests passing - maintain this standard
- Channel selection and video filtering working correctly

### Data Models
- **Digest Run**: `digest_run(id, user_id, scheduled_for, sent_at, status)` [Source: architecture/data-model-draft.md]
- **Digest Item**: `digest_item(digest_run_id, video_id, position)` [Source: architecture/data-model-draft.md]
- **User**: Leverage existing user model with email preferences [Source: architecture/data-model-draft.md]

### API Specifications
- **POST /digests/run** - Send manual digest email (aligns with architecture) [Source: architecture/api-design-rest-nestjs.md]
- **GET /digests/latest** - Get user's latest digest metadata [Source: architecture/api-design-rest-nestjs.md]
- **GET /digests/:id** - Get signed link web view [Source: architecture/api-design-rest-nestjs.md]

### Component Specifications
- **Send Digest Button**: Prominent placement on dashboard, Ant Design Button component
- **Email Preferences Modal**: Ant Design Modal with form controls for frequency/template
- **Success/Error Notifications**: Ant Design notification system
- **Digest Web View**: Responsive HTML page for digest content

### File Locations
- **Backend Service**: `src/modules/digests/digests.service.ts` (new file)
- **Backend Controller**: `src/modules/digests/digests.controller.ts` (new file)
- **Email Infrastructure**: `src/infra/email/` (new directory)
- **Frontend Button**: `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` (enhance existing)
- **Frontend Preferences**: `frontend/src/components/molecules/EmailPreferencesModal.tsx` (new file)

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Services (digest generation, email sending), adapters (mock email providers) [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end digest generation and email delivery [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **API Tests**: Supertest for digest endpoints and auth flows [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Frontend Tests**: Component testing for digest button and preferences modal

### Technical Constraints
- Maintain existing OAuth token encryption/decryption patterns
- Follow established CORS and cookie handling patterns
- Use React Query for data fetching and caching
- Implement responsive design with Ant Design
- Ensure email templates work across major email clients

### Email Provider Configuration
- **Development**: Use Nodemailer with local SMTP or test service (Mailtrap recommended)
- **Production**: Use SendGrid or similar transactional email service
- **Environment Variables**: Configure SMTP settings or API keys as needed
- **Template Engine**: Use Handlebars or similar for HTML email templates

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize digest generation for large video lists
- Implement email delivery queuing for high volume
- Use efficient database queries for video aggregation
- Minimize email template size for faster delivery
