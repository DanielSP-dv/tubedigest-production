## üõ†Ô∏è **Dev Notes**

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1 successfully implemented real YouTube API integration via OAuth tokens
- Channel selection persistence working with database integration
- React Query integration proven effective for data management
- Ant Design components provide excellent UX foundation
- All backend tests passing (104/104) - maintain this standard

### Data Models
- **Channel Subscriptions**: `channel_subscription(user_id, channel_id, title, selected_at)` [Source: architecture/data-model-draft.md]
- **Videos**: `video(id, channel_id, title, url, published_at, duration_s)` [Source: architecture/data-model-draft.md]
- **User Preferences**: Leverage existing user model with channel associations

### API Specifications
- **GET /channels/selected** - Fetch user's selected channels [Source: architecture/api-design-rest-nestjs.md]
- **POST /channels/select {channelIds: string[]}** - Update channel selections (limit 10) [Source: architecture/api-design-rest-nestjs.md]
- **GET /videos/digest** - Fetch videos for digest (filtered by selected channels) [Source: architecture/api-design-rest-nestjs.md]
- **GET /digests/latest** - Get user's latest digest metadata [Source: architecture/api-design-rest-nestjs.md]

### Component Specifications
- **Enhanced Dashboard**: Extend existing `Dashboard` component with collapsible sidebar
- **ChannelManagementSidebar**: New component for channel toggle management

- **Services**: `frontend/src/services/videos.ts` (new file for video filtering)
- **Backend**: `src/modules/videos/videos.controller.ts` (enhance existing)

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Services (summaries, transcripts, digests), adapters (mock providers) [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end job chains in local env with test Redis/Postgres [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **API Tests**: Supertest for endpoint contracts and auth flows [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Frontend Tests**: Component testing for sidebar functionality and video filtering

### Technical Constraints
- Maintain existing OAuth token encryption/decryption patterns
- Follow established CORS and cookie handling patterns
- Use React Query for data fetching and caching
- Implement responsive design with Ant Design
- Ensure real-time channel state synchronization

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize video feed filtering for large channel lists

## QA Results

### Review Date: January 18, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Implementation meets the story requirements with clean, readable code and comprehensive tests. UI behavior (sidebar collapse, channel toggles, empty states, refresh) works as expected. Backend filtering by selected channels is implemented correctly and covered by tests.

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
- **Change**: Normalized Ant Design imports to recommended pattern (`import { Layout } from 'antd'` and use `Layout.Sider`)
- **Why**: Follows Ant Design best practices and avoids deep imports that can break with updates
- **How**: Improves maintainability and reduces potential import issues

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
- **Change**: Replaced `window.location.reload()` with React Query invalidation (`queryClient.invalidateQueries()`)
- **Why**: Provides smoother UX without full page reloads, better performance
- **How**: Uses React Query's built-in cache invalidation for targeted data refresh

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
- **Change**: Replaced `window.location.href` with React Router navigation (`useNavigate()`)
- **Why**: Maintains SPA behavior and better user experience
- **How**: Uses proper React Router navigation instead of browser navigation

**File**: `frontend/src/components/molecules/ChannelManagementSidebar.tsx`
- **Change**: Added utility function `createTitlesObject()` to reduce code duplication
- **Why**: Eliminates repeated logic for creating titles object from selected channels
- **How**: Improves code maintainability and reduces potential bugs

**File**: `frontend/src/pages/__tests__/Dashboard.test.tsx`
- **Change**: Added BrowserRouter wrapper to test setup and updated test expectations
- **Why**: Fixes test failures caused by useNavigate hook requiring Router context
- **How**: Ensures tests properly mock React Router functionality

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ‚úì (Improved with normalized imports and proper patterns)
- Project Structure: ‚úì
- Testing Strategy: ‚úì (All 25 frontend tests passing, 3 backend tests passing)
- All ACs Met: ‚úì

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Replace `window.location.reload()` with React Query cache invalidation for a smoother UX
- [x] Prefer router navigation (`useNavigate`) over `window.location.href` for SPA navigation
- [x] Normalize Ant Design Layout imports to recommended pattern
- [x] Add utility function to reduce code duplication in channel management
- [x] Fix test setup to properly handle React Router context
- [ ] Consider adding an integration test covering channel toggle ‚Üí feed refresh end-to-end

### Security Review

No sensitive data exposure detected. Existing cookie/session handling remains unchanged and safe for MVP (note: ensure `secure` cookies in production).

### Performance Considerations

Significantly improved by replacing full page reloads with React Query invalidation. This reduces network load and provides instant feedback to users. The debounced refresh system in the sidebar provides excellent UX for channel management.

### Final Status

‚úì **Approved - Ready for Done**

**Summary**: Story 2 implementation is complete and has been significantly improved through senior developer refactoring. All acceptance criteria are met, tests are comprehensive and passing, and the code follows best practices for React, Ant Design, and React Query usage.
