## 📝 **Dev Notes**

### **Previous Story Insights**
From Story 1.6 implementation:
- Session persistence is working correctly with localStorage and backend validation
- NavigationGuard component handles authentication and routing effectively
- useSession hook provides centralized session state management
- OAuth flow integration is stable and functional

### **Data Models**
Based on existing architecture:
- User session data structure: `{ user: User, isAuthenticated: boolean, lastChecked: number, hasCompletedOnboarding: boolean }`
- Channel data structure: `{ id: string, title: string, selected: boolean, order: number }`
- Digest preferences: `{ frequency: string, time: string, content: DigestContentOptions }`

### **API Specifications**
[Source: docs/architecture.md#api-design]
- `GET /me` - Current user profile and settings
- `POST /auth/logout` - Logout endpoint with session cleanup
- `PUT /channels/:id` - Update channel selection and order
- `POST /channels/import` - Bulk channel import
- `DELETE /channels/:id` - Remove channel with confirmation
- `GET /digests/preferences` - Get user digest preferences
- `PUT /digests/preferences` - Update digest preferences

### **Component Specifications**
[Source: docs/frontend-backend-architecture/frontend-architecture.md]

**UserProfile Component:**
```typescript
interface UserProfileProps {
  user: User;
  onLogout: () => void;
  onSettings: () => void;
}
```

**EnhancedChannelManagement Component:**
```typescript
interface EnhancedChannelManagementProps {
  channels: Channel[];
  onReorder: (channels: Channel[]) => void;
  onImport: (channelIds: string[]) => void;
  onRemove: (channelId: string) => void;
  onToggle: (channelId: string, selected: boolean) => void;
}
```

**LoadingSpinner Component:**
```typescript
interface LoadingSpinnerProps {
  loading: boolean;
  text?: string;
  size?: 'small' | 'default' | 'large';
  type?: 'spinner' | 'progress' | 'skeleton';
}
```

### **File Locations**
Based on project structure:
- `frontend/src/components/atoms/` - Basic UI components (LoadingSpinner, ChannelCountBadge)
- `frontend/src/components/molecules/` - UserProfile, UserProfileDropdown, ActionFeedback
- `frontend/src/components/organisms/` - EnhancedChannelManagement, DigestConfiguration
- `frontend/src/components/templates/` - EnhancedDashboardLayout
- `frontend/src/pages/` - AccountSettings page
- `frontend/src/hooks/` - useUserProfile, useChannelManagement, useDigestPreferences
- `frontend/src/services/` - Enhanced API services for new features

### **Testing Requirements**
[Source: docs/architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- Unit tests for all new components using React Testing Library
- Integration tests for user flows and API interactions
- E2E tests for complete user journeys
- Performance testing for new UI components
- Mobile responsiveness testing across device sizes

### **Technical Constraints**
- Must use Ant Design 5.x components for consistency
- React 18+ features for enhanced performance
- TypeScript for type safety
- React Query for state management
- Vite for build optimization
- Mobile-first responsive design

### **Performance Considerations**
- Lazy loading for heavy components (channel management, digest configuration)
- Optimistic updates for better perceived performance
- Debounced search and filtering
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo and useMemo
- Bundle size optimization for new components

### **Security Considerations**
- Proper session cleanup on logout
- Input validation for user preferences
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- Secure handling of user profile data
