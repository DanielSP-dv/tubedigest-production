## Story Number

## Title
Fix Logout Functionality

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to successfully log out of the application,
**so that** my session is properly terminated and I can securely end my session.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. User can click logout button and successfully log out
2. Backend logout endpoint responds with 200 status (not 403)
3. User session is properly cleared on both frontend and backend
4. User is redirected to landing page after logout
5. User stays logged out (no automatic re-authentication)
6. No CSRF token errors during logout process
7. Other authenticated endpoints continue to work normally
8. Logout functionality works consistently across different browsers

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Investigate current logout implementation (AC: 1, 2, 6)
  - [ ] Analyze current security middleware configuration
  - [ ] Review frontend logout function implementation
  - [ ] Check CSRF token handling in logout flow
  - [ ] Identify root cause of 403 error

- [ ] Task 2: Fix backend logout endpoint (AC: 2, 3, 6)
  - [ ] Ensure `/api/auth/logout` is properly excluded from CSRF validation
  - [ ] Verify security middleware configuration is correct
  - [ ] Test logout endpoint responds with 200 status
  - [ ] Ensure session clearing works properly

- [ ] Task 3: Fix frontend logout function (AC: 1, 3, 4, 5)
  - [ ] Simplify logout function to remove CSRF token fetching
  - [ ] Ensure proper session clearing on frontend
  - [ ] Implement proper redirect to landing page
  - [ ] Prevent automatic re-authentication after logout

- [ ] Task 4: Implement comprehensive testing (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
  - [ ] Create unit tests for logout functionality
  - [ ] Create integration tests for logout flow
  - [ ] Test logout across different browsers
  - [ ] Verify no regression in other authentication flows
  - [ ] Test logout with different user states

- [ ] Task 5: Deploy and validate fix (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
  - [ ] Deploy changes to production
  - [ ] Test logout functionality in production environment
  - [ ] Verify all acceptance criteria are met
  - [ ] Monitor for any errors or regressions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 1.1 attempted to disable CSRF tokens for logout but the fix didn't work as expected
- The logout endpoint still returns 403 errors despite CSRF token exclusion
- Frontend logout works but backend logout fails, causing user re-authentication
- Current implementation shows CSRF token is fetched but logout request still fails

### Data Models
- User session management: Session data stored in cookies and local storage
- Authentication state: `{user: User | null, isLoading: boolean, isAuthenticated: boolean, error: string | null}`
- [Source: docs/architecture/authentication-architecture-fix.md#authentication-state-management]

### API Specifications
- Logout endpoint: `POST /api/auth/logout`
- Should be excluded from CSRF validation according to authentication architecture
- Should clear session cookies and return 200 status
- [Source: docs/architecture/authentication-architecture-fix.md#public-routes]

### Component Specifications
- Frontend logout function in `frontend/src/services/auth.ts`
- Should handle logout without CSRF token fetching
- Should clear local session storage and redirect to landing page
- [Source: docs/architecture/authentication-architecture-fix.md#dashboard-with-sign-out]

### File Locations
- Backend security middleware: `src/modules/security/security.middleware.ts`
- Frontend auth service: `frontend/src/services/auth.ts`
- Auth controller: `src/modules/auth/auth.controller.ts`
- [Source: docs/source-tree.md]

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests: Test logout service functions
- Integration tests: End-to-end logout flow testing
- API tests: Test logout endpoint with supertest
- Browser tests: Test logout across different browsers
- [Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain CSRF protection for other state-changing operations
- Must ensure logout endpoint remains protected by session validation
- Must follow NestJS patterns and TypeScript standards
- Must not break existing authentication flows
- [Source: docs/architecture/authentication-architecture-fix.md#route-protection-strategy]

### Security Considerations
- Logout endpoint should be public (no auth required) but should clear session
- CSRF protection should be disabled for logout endpoint only
- Session clearing must be comprehensive (cookies, local storage, state)
- [Source: docs/architecture/security.md]

## Testing
- **Test file location**: `src/modules/auth/__tests__/auth.service.spec.ts`
- **Test standards**: Use Jest and supertest for API testing
- **Testing frameworks**: Jest for unit tests, supertest for API tests, Playwright for E2E
- **Specific testing requirements**: 
  - Test logout endpoint returns 200 status
  - Test session clearing works properly
  - Test user stays logged out after logout
  - Test no CSRF token errors during logout
  - Test other authenticated endpoints still work

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4

### Debug Log References
- Backend deployment in progress - 502 Bad Gateway errors during testing
- Logout endpoint returning 404 for `/api/auth/logout` and 403 for `/auth/logout`
- Root cause identified: Backend routes not properly configured with `/api` prefix

### Completion Notes List
- **Task 1 COMPLETED**: Investigated current logout implementation
  - Found that security middleware correctly excludes `/api/auth/logout` from CSRF validation
  - Frontend logout function uses direct `fetch` calls (correct implementation)
  - Auth controller properly implements logout endpoint
  - **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: Backend routes not configured with `/api` prefix that frontend expects

- **Task 2 COMPLETED**: Fix backend logout endpoint
  - Added global API prefix to `src/main.ts` using `app.setGlobalPrefix('api')`
  - Backend now correctly responds to `/api/auth/logout` with 200 status
  - Logout endpoint returns `{"success":true,"message":"Logout successful"}`
  - No CSRF token errors - endpoint properly excluded from CSRF validation

- **Task 3 COMPLETED**: Fix frontend logout function
  - Frontend logout function was already correctly implemented
  - Uses direct `fetch` calls without CSRF token fetching
  - No changes needed

- **Task 4 IN PROGRESS**: Implement comprehensive testing
  - Backend logout endpoint tested and working ✅
  - Frontend deployment in progress (Vercel rewrites not yet active)

- **Task 5 IN PROGRESS**: Deploy and validate fix
  - Backend deployed and working ✅
  - Frontend deployment in progress

### File List
- `src/main.ts` - Added global API prefix configuration
- `frontend/vercel.json` - Updated Vercel rewrites to match backend API prefix
- `src/modules/security/security.middleware.ts` - Already correctly configured
- `frontend/src/services/auth.ts` - Already correctly implemented
- `src/modules/auth/auth.controller.ts` - Already correctly implemented
