# Story 1.8: Advanced Authentication and Security Enhancement

## üéØ **Story Overview**

**Status: Draft**

**As a security-conscious user of TubeDigest,**
**I want enhanced authentication security, token management, and privacy controls,**
**so that my YouTube account and personal data are protected with enterprise-grade security measures.**

## üìã **Acceptance Criteria**

### **Given** a user is authenticated with Google OAuth
### **When** they interact with the authentication system
### **Then** they should:

**Enhanced Token Management:**
- [ ] **AC1**: OAuth tokens are encrypted at rest in the database
- [ ] **AC2**: Token refresh mechanism automatically handles expired access tokens
- [ ] **AC3**: Users can view and revoke their OAuth connections
- [ ] **AC4**: Token expiry is properly handled with graceful degradation

**Security Enhancements:**
- [ ] **AC5**: Session tokens are cryptographically signed and validated
- [ ] **AC6**: Rate limiting is implemented for authentication endpoints
- [ ] **AC7**: Failed authentication attempts are logged and monitored
- [ ] **AC8**: CSRF protection is implemented for all state-changing operations

**Privacy and Data Protection:**
- [ ] **AC9**: Users can export their personal data in a structured format
- [ ] **AC10**: Users can request complete data deletion (GDPR compliance)
- [ ] **AC11**: Privacy policy and terms of service are accessible
- [ ] **AC12**: Data retention policies are clearly communicated

**Account Security:**
- [ ] **AC13**: Users receive email notifications for suspicious login attempts
- [ ] **AC14**: Account lockout mechanism for repeated failed attempts
- [ ] **AC15**: Users can view their login history and active sessions
- [ ] **AC16**: Two-factor authentication is available (future enhancement placeholder)

**Integration Verification:**
- [ ] **AC17**: All existing authentication flows continue to work seamlessly
- [ ] **AC18**: Session persistence from Story 1.6 remains functional
- [ ] **AC19**: UI/UX enhancements from Story 1.7 integrate properly
- [ ] **AC20**: Performance impact of security measures is minimal

## üìù **Dev Notes**

### **Previous Story Insights**
From Story 1.6 implementation:
- Session persistence uses localStorage with backend validation
- OAuth flow is stable with proper cookie management
- NavigationGuard component handles authentication routing
- useSession hook provides centralized session state management

From Story 1.7 implementation:
- UserProfile component provides account management interface
- AccountSettings page exists for user preferences
- Layout consistency and UI components are established
- Test infrastructure is in place with Ant Design mocking

### **Data Models**
Based on existing architecture:
[Source: docs/architecture/data-model-draft.md]

**Enhanced User Model:**
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  timezone: string;
  created_at: Date;
  last_login: Date;
  login_attempts: number;
  locked_until?: Date;
  security_settings: SecuritySettings;
}

interface SecuritySettings {
  email_notifications: boolean;
  session_timeout: number;
  require_reauth_for_sensitive_actions: boolean;
}
```

**Enhanced OAuth Token Model:**
```typescript
interface OAuthToken {
  user_id: string;
  provider: 'google' | 'youtube';
  encrypted_access_token: string;
  encrypted_refresh_token: string;
  expires_at: Date;
  created_at: Date;
  last_refreshed: Date;
  is_active: boolean;
}
```

**Security Event Log:**
```typescript
interface SecurityEvent {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  event_type: 'login' | 'logout' | 'failed_login' | 'token_refresh' | 'password_change';
  ip_address: string;
  user_agent: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  metadata: Record<string, any>;
}
```

### **API Specifications**

```typescript
interface SecuritySettingsProps {
  user: User;
  onSettingsUpdate: (settings: SecuritySettings) => void;
  onExportData: () => void;
  onDeleteAccount: () => void;
}
```

### **Testing Requirements**
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Security Testing:**
- Unit tests for token encryption/decryption
- Integration tests for rate limiting
- API tests for authentication endpoints
- E2E tests for complete security flows
- Penetration testing for security vulnerabilities

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- 90%+ coverage for security-critical code
- 100% coverage for encryption/decryption functions
- Integration tests for all security endpoints
- Performance tests for rate limiting

### **Technical Constraints**
- Must use environment-based encryption keys
- Rate limiting must be configurable per endpoint
- Token refresh must be automatic and transparent
- Security logging must not impact performance
- All security measures must be GDPR compliant

### **Security Considerations**
- Encryption keys must be stored securely (not in code)
- Rate limiting must prevent brute force attacks
- Session tokens must be cryptographically secure
- Audit logs must be tamper-evident
- Data deletion must be complete and verifiable

### **Performance Considerations**
- Token encryption/decryption must be fast
- Rate limiting must not impact legitimate users
- Security logging must be asynchronous
- Session validation must be efficient
- Data export must handle large datasets
