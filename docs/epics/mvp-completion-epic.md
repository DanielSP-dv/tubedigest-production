TubeDigest MVP Completion - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Complete the MVP user flow by adding channel selection onboarding, enhanced dashboard with channel management, and email digest system to deliver a fully functional YouTube digest application that allows users to select channels, manage their feed, and send email digests with video summaries.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Landing page with "Create Your First Digest" button, Google OAuth authentication flow, basic dashboard with video feed, backend API with CORS configured, React frontend with Ant Design
- Technology stack: NestJS backend, React frontend with Ant Design, PostgreSQL database, Redis + BullMQ for background jobs, YouTube Data API v3 integration
- Integration points: OAuth callback flow, existing dashboard component, video feed API endpoints, channel management system

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Complete user onboarding flow with channel selection, enhanced dashboard with collapsible sidebar for channel management, and email digest system with "Send Digest" functionality
- How it integrates: Extends existing OAuth flow, enhances current dashboard, adds new API endpoints for channel preferences and email delivery
- Success criteria: Users can complete full flow from landing page to email digest, channel management works seamlessly, email delivery is reliable

## Stories

List 3 focused stories that complete the epic:

1. **Story 1: Channel Selection Onboarding** - Create new onboarding page after authentication where users can select their YouTube channels with toggle interface and "Next" button to proceed to dashboard
2. **Story 2: Enhanced Dashboard with Channel Management** - Add collapsible sidebar to dashboard with channel toggle switches, refresh functionality, and filtered video feed based on selected channels
3. **Story 3: Email Digest System** - Implement "Send Digest" button on dashboard with email service integration, digest generation logic, and professional email templates with video summaries

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged (new endpoints added, existing ones preserved)
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible (new tables for user preferences)
- [ ] UI changes follow existing Ant Design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal (efficient channel filtering, optimized email generation)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Breaking existing authentication flow or dashboard functionality
- **Mitigation:** Extend existing components rather than replace, maintain current API contracts, thorough testing of integration points
- **Rollback Plan:** Feature flags for new components, database migrations are reversible, ability to disable new features without affecting core functionality

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 3 stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing authentication and dashboard functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly (OAuth â†’ Channel Selection â†’ Dashboard â†’ Email)
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately (user flow, API endpoints, database schema)
- [ ] No regression in existing features (landing page, authentication, basic dashboard)
- [ ] Email delivery system tested and functional
- [ ] Channel management sidebar responsive and accessible

## Technical Integration Points

**Frontend Integration:**
- Extend existing React Router setup with new routes
- Enhance current Dashboard component with sidebar
- Add new ChannelSelectionPage component
- Integrate with existing Ant Design component library

**Backend Integration:**
- Extend existing OAuth callback to redirect to channel selection
- Add new API endpoints for channel preferences
- Integrate email service (Nodemailer/SendGrid)
- Enhance existing video feed API with channel filtering

**Database Integration:**
- Add user_channel_selections table for storing preferences
- Extend existing user model with channel preferences
- Add digest_sends table for tracking email delivery

**External Service Integration:**
- YouTube Data API v3 for fetching subscribed channels
- Email service provider (Nodemailer/SendGrid) for digest delivery
- Maintain existing YouTube API integration for video fetching

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Complete user flow works end-to-end: Landing â†’ Auth â†’ Channel Selection â†’ Dashboard â†’ Email Digest
- [ ] Channel selection page loads within 3 seconds
- [ ] Dashboard with sidebar loads within 2 seconds
- [ ] Email delivery success rate > 95%
- [ ] No errors in navigation flow between components
- [ ] Channel preferences persist across sessions
- [ ] Email templates render correctly across email clients

## Dependencies

## Implementation Notes

This epic builds upon the existing working foundation of the TubeDigest application. The enhancement follows the established patterns and integrates seamlessly with the current architecture. Each story is designed to be implemented independently while maintaining system integrity and user experience continuity.

The brownfield approach ensures that existing functionality remains intact while adding the missing pieces needed for a complete MVP user experience.
