# Compatibility Requirements

## API Contract Preservation
- [ ] **Existing endpoints remain unchanged:**
  - `GET /auth/google` - OAuth initiation (no changes)
  - `GET /auth/google/callback` - OAuth callback (enhanced to redirect to channel selection)
  - `GET /me` - User profile (no changes)
  - `GET /channels` - Channel listing (no changes)
  - `GET /videos/digest` - Video feed (enhanced with channel filtering)
  - `GET /health` - Health check (no changes)

## Database Schema Compatibility
- [ ] **Backward compatible migrations:**
  - New `user_channel_selections` table (additive, no existing data affected)
  - New `digest_sends` table (additive, no existing data affected)
  - Optional `user_preferences` table for email settings (nullable fields)
  - All existing tables (`users`, `channels`, `videos`, `transcripts`) remain unchanged
  - Migration scripts include rollback procedures

## UI/UX Pattern Consistency
- [ ] **Ant Design component adherence:**
  - Use existing `Layout` component structure
  - Follow established color scheme and typography
  - Maintain responsive breakpoints (mobile-first approach)
  - Preserve existing loading states and error handling patterns
  - Use consistent spacing and padding from design system

## Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] **Performance impact limits:**
  - Channel selection page load time: < 3 seconds (current dashboard: ~2s)
  - Dashboard with sidebar load time: < 2.5 seconds (current: ~2s)
  - API response times: < 500ms for new endpoints
  - Database query performance: < 100ms for channel filtering
  - Email generation: < 5 seconds for digest creation
  - Memory usage: < 10% increase over current baseline

## Browser and Device Compatibility
- [ ] **Cross-platform support:**
  - Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
  - Mobile responsive: iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Mobile 90+
  - Tablet support: iPad Safari 14+, Android Chrome 90+
  - Progressive Web App (PWA) compatibility maintained

## Integration Point Stability
- [ ] **External service compatibility:**
  - YouTube Data API v3 integration remains unchanged
  - OAuth 2.0 flow compatibility preserved
  - Email service integration (Nodemailer/SendGrid) follows existing patterns
  - Redis/BullMQ job processing compatibility maintained
