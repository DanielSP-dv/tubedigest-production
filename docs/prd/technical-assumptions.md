# Technical Assumptions
- Repository Structure: Monorepo (single NestJS service)
- Service Architecture: Monolith (NestJS)
- Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration (services, jobs)
- Additional Assumptions and Requests:
  - YouTube Data API v3 for uploads/captions; Search API as fallback discovery
  - Email provider preference: Listmonk or Mautic; fallback Postmark/SendGrid
  - LLM via Ollama (Qwen/Llama family); optional hosted free tier; adapter abstraction
  - Postgres primary DB; Redis + BullMQ for jobs
  - Default schedule: daily 09:00 local; weekly optional
  - Optional ASR fallback (e.g., Whisper) behind a feature flag for videos without captions
  - Email deliverability: SPF/DKIM/DMARC required and sender warmup plan
  - Digest personalization: per‑user filters and “top N” cap configurable to control noise
