# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Deliver daily/weekly digest of new videos from user-selected channels (≤10)
- Provide concise paragraph summaries plus chaptered timestamps
- Let users save items to a Watch Later list and search later
- Reduce time spent watching while keeping users fully informed

## Background Context
TubeDigest targets heavy YouTube learners who follow multiple long‑form educational channels. They want to scan what’s new quickly, pick what’s worth watching, and avoid time sinks. The MVP connects a YouTube account, lets users pick channels, summarizes new uploads, and emails a daily/weekly digest with clear CTAs to save videos.
