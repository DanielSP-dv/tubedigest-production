# **Implementation Tasks**

## **Task 1: Audit Backend Static File Configuration (AC: 6, 7, 8)**
- [ ] Search for static file serving middleware in backend code
- [ ] Remove any static file serving configuration that serves frontend content
- [ ] Verify backend only serves API responses on port 3001
- [ ] Test that backend no longer serves HTML content for API endpoints

## **Task 2: Test API Endpoints (AC: 1, 4, 5)**
- [ ] Test `/health` endpoint returns JSON health status
- [ ] Test `/api/me` endpoint returns JSON user data or proper error response
- [ ] Test `/channels` endpoint returns JSON channel list
- [ ] Test all other API endpoints for proper JSON responses
- [ ] Verify content-type headers are `application/json` for all API endpoints

## **Task 3: Fix Authentication Flow (AC: 2, 9, 10)**
- [ ] Ensure `/api/me` endpoint works correctly and returns proper JSON
- [ ] Test authentication service integration with backend
- [ ] Verify login/logout flow completes successfully
- [ ] Test protected route access with proper authentication
- [ ] Verify authentication state persists across page reloads

## **Task 4: Validate Port Configuration (AC: 6, 7, 8)**
- [ ] Confirm backend runs on port 3001 only
- [ ] Confirm frontend runs on port 3000 only
- [ ] Test Vite proxy configuration forwards `/api/*` to backend correctly
- [ ] Verify no port conflicts between frontend and backend services
- [ ] Test that both services can run simultaneously without conflicts

## **Task 5: Integration Testing (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10)**
- [ ] Test complete authentication flow end-to-end
- [ ] Test frontend-backend communication for all features
- [ ] Verify all existing features work correctly after fixes
- [ ] Test error handling and graceful failure scenarios
- [ ] Verify no regression in existing functionality
