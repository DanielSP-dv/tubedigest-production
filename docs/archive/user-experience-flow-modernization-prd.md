## Epic Title

User Experience Flow Modernization - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Transform TubeDigest into a streamlined, intuitive application with beautiful onboarding, real-time dashboard, and seamless channel management, while maintaining all existing functionality and following established patterns.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

- **Current relevant functionality**: OAuth authentication, channel management, video digest generation, email delivery
- **Technology stack**: React 18+, NestJS, Ant Design 5.x, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Integration points**: OAuth flow, channel selection APIs, video digest system, email delivery
- **Existing patterns**: React Query + Zustand state management, Ant Design components, REST API patterns

### Enhancement Scope

**Enhancement Type**: UI/UX Overhaul + Major Feature Modification

**Enhancement Description**: 
Transform the current multi-page, inconsistent authentication experience into a streamlined onboarding flow: Landing page → Login → Channel selection → Dashboard, with persistent session management and clear user progression.

**Impact Assessment**: Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes)
- Frontend routing and navigation overhaul
- Authentication flow restructuring
- Session management enhancements
- User onboarding experience redesign

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Create a single, clear user journey from first visit to active usage
- Eliminate authentication confusion and multiple login points
- Provide intuitive onboarding with channel selection
- Maintain session persistence across browser sessions
- Simplify navigation and reduce cognitive load

### Background Context
Currently, users can access different parts of the application without clear authentication state, leading to confusion and poor user experience. The recent authentication flow fixes resolved security issues but highlighted the need for a complete UX overhaul. Users need a clear path from landing page through authentication to channel selection and finally to the dashboard, with persistent sessions that maintain their state.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements (FR)

**FR1**: Users land on a welcoming landing page that clearly explains TubeDigest value proposition
**FR2**: Landing page has prominent "Create Digest" or "Get Started" button that initiates authentication flow
**FR3**: Authentication flow uses existing OAuth system but provides clear login/account creation options
**FR4**: After successful authentication, new users are automatically redirected to one-time channel selection onboarding
**FR5**: Channel selection onboarding is a beautiful, centered interface similar to Twitter/X account creation
**FR6**: Channel selection shows user's YouTube subscriptions with simple selection interface (up to 10 channels)
**FR7**: "Next" button triggers background loading animation while retrieving video summaries
**FR8**: After onboarding, users land on dashboard with feed of latest videos from selected channels
**FR9**: Dashboard shows video feed with: title, channel, length, reading time, timestamps, summaries
**FR10**: Users can create digest/newsletter from dashboard with "Send Now" or "Schedule" options
**FR11**: Scheduling allows daily, every few days, or custom cadence selection
**FR12**: Channel management page allows users to select/deselect channels (accessible after onboarding)
**FR13**: Channel changes trigger automatic feed refresh to show updated video content
**FR14**: Session persistence maintains user authentication state across browser sessions
**FR15**: Returning users with valid session go directly to dashboard (skip onboarding)

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

**NFR1**: Landing page loads in under 2 seconds with clear value proposition
**NFR2**: Authentication flow completes in under 30 seconds for returning users
**NFR3**: Channel selection onboarding is intuitive and visually appealing (Twitter/X style)
**NFR4**: Background loading animation provides clear feedback during video retrieval
**NFR5**: Dashboard feed loads within 3 seconds and shows real-time video updates
**NFR6**: Video feed updates dynamically when channels post new content (real-time or near real-time)
**NFR7**: All existing functionality (digest generation, email delivery, search) remains intact
**NFR8**: Mobile-responsive design maintains usability across all device sizes
**NFR9**: Channel management interface is simple and intuitive for ongoing channel adjustments

### Compatibility Requirements (CR)

**CR1**: Existing OAuth flow and token management system must remain compatible
**CR2**: Current API endpoints and data models must continue to function
**CR3**: Existing email digest functionality must remain unchanged
**CR4**: Current user data and channel selections must be preserved during transition

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript
**Frameworks**: React 18+, NestJS, Ant Design 5.x
**Database**: PostgreSQL, Redis
**Infrastructure**: Vite bundler, React Router v6, React Query + Zustand
**External Dependencies**: YouTube Data API v3, Google OAuth, Email providers

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Extend existing user and channel tables to support onboarding state and real-time feed updates
**API Integration Strategy**: Enhance existing OAuth and channel APIs to support onboarding flow and real-time video retrieval
**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Create new onboarding components while maintaining existing dashboard and channel management functionality
**Testing Integration Strategy**: Extend existing test suite to cover onboarding flow and real-time updates

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Follow existing React component hierarchy with new onboarding-specific components
**Naming Conventions**: Maintain existing TypeScript and React naming patterns
**Coding Standards**: Follow established Ant Design component patterns and existing code style
**Documentation Standards**: Update existing documentation to reflect new onboarding flow

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Integrate new components into existing Vite build pipeline
**Deployment Strategy**: Deploy frontend changes alongside existing backend enhancements
**Monitoring and Logging**: Extend existing logging to track onboarding completion and real-time updates
**Configuration Management**: Maintain existing environment configuration patterns

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: Real-time feed updates may impact performance; implement efficient caching and pagination
**Integration Risks**: Onboarding flow must integrate seamlessly with existing OAuth system; thorough testing required
**Deployment Risks**: New components must not break existing functionality; implement feature flags for gradual rollout
**Mitigation Strategies**: Comprehensive testing, performance monitoring, and rollback capabilities
