# Story 4.1 â€” Email Template and Data Quality Improvements

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a** user receiving email digests,

5. All video metadata (title, duration, published date) displays correctly
6. Email layout is responsive and visually appealing
7. Error handling prevents email delivery failures due to data issues
8. System validates data quality before sending emails
