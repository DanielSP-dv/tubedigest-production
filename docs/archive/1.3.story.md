# Story 1.3 — List YouTube subscriptions (GET /channels)

## Status: Done

## Story
As a user,
I want the app to list my YouTube channel subscriptions,
so that I can pick which channels to include in my digest.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `GET /channels` returns 200 with an array of `{ channelId, title, thumbnail }` for the connected account
2. Uses minimal read-only scopes and refresh-token flow if access token expired
3. On missing connection, returns 401/403 with a clear message
4. Quota/rate-limit and network errors are logged; client receives friendly error
5. Response is limited/paginated as needed (pageToken support)

## Dev Notes (from Architecture)
- Use stored encrypted tokens; decrypt in-memory; never log tokens
- YouTube Data API Subscriptions:list (mine=true), Channels:list for thumbnails if needed
- Respect quotas and add backoff on failure

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Service: load latest OAuthToken for user, decrypt tokens, refresh if needed
- [x] Integrate google APIs to call Subscriptions:list; map to DTO `{ channelId, title, thumbnail }`
- [x] Controller: `GET /channels` → call service; support `pageToken` (optional)
- [x] Error handling: missing tokens → 401/403; quota/network → 5xx with friendly message
- [x] Tests: mock API client; assert mapping and error cases

## Testing
- [x] When no tokens, `GET /channels` returns 401/403
- [x] When API returns subscriptions, endpoint maps and returns array
- [x] When API errors with rate limit, endpoint returns 503 and logs

## Constraints
- Read-only scopes; no secrets in logs; quotas respected

## File List (to be maintained by Dev)
- (Dev to populate)

## Dev Agent Record (Dev‑only to update)
- Agent Model Used: Claude Sonnet 4
- Debug Log References: QA testing session - YouTube subscriptions API integration verified
- Completion Notes: YouTube subscriptions API integration fully implemented with proper error handling, token management, and data mapping. All acceptance criteria met.
- Change Log: Status → Done; all tasks completed and tested
