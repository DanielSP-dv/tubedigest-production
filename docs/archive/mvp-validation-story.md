# Story: MVP Feature Validation & Testing

## Status: In Progress

## Story
As a QA Architect, I need to systematically validate all MVP must-have features to ensure the application meets the core requirements and is ready for user testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] YouTube OAuth + channel picker (limit 10) - ✅ Working
- [ ] Automatic summaries with timestamped chapters - ⚠️ Needs testing
- [ ] HTML email digest delivery - ⚠️ Needs testing  
- [ ] Save to Watch Later + search in dashboard - ⚠️ Needs testing

## Current Status Assessment

### ✅ **Feature 1: YouTube OAuth + Channel Picker**
- **Status**: ✅ WORKING
- **Evidence**: 
  - OAuth flow completes successfully
  - User can log in with Google account
  - Channel Management page loads with mock data
  - UI shows subscribe/unsubscribe functionality
- **Next**: Test with real YouTube API integration

### ⚠️ **Feature 2: Automatic Summaries with Timestamped Chapters**
- **Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS TESTING
- **Current State**: Dashboard shows mock video digests with chapters
- **Evidence**: 
  - Video cards display "Chapters (4): 0m - Introduction, 5m - Main Topic 1, etc."
  - Mock data shows proper chapter structure
- **Next**: Test real video processing pipeline

### ⚠️ **Feature 3: HTML Email Digest Delivery**
- **Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS TESTING
- **Current State**: Email service exists but untested
- **Evidence**: 
  - Email module loaded in backend
  - Digest scheduling endpoint exists
- **Next**: Test email generation and delivery

### ⚠️ **Feature 4: Save to Watch Later + Search**
- **Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS TESTING
- **Current State**: UI shows "Save" buttons but functionality untested
- **Evidence**: 
  - Dashboard has search functionality
  - Video cards have "Save" buttons
- **Next**: Test save functionality and search

## Testing Plan

### **Phase 1: Core Functionality Testing**
1. **OAuth Integration Test**
   - Test with real YouTube API
   - Verify channel selection works
   - Test channel limit enforcement

2. **Video Processing Pipeline Test**
   - Test video ingestion
   - Test transcript processing
   - Test chapter generation
   - Test summary generation

3. **Email System Test**
   - Test digest generation
   - Test email template rendering
   - Test email delivery
   - Test scheduling functionality

4. **Save & Search Test**
   - Test video saving functionality
   - Test search across saved videos
   - Test dashboard filtering

### **Phase 2: Integration Testing**
1. **End-to-End Workflow Test**
   - Complete user journey from login to digest delivery
   - Test all user interactions
   - Verify data persistence

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Test with multiple channels
   - Test with large video libraries
   - Test email delivery performance

### **Phase 3: User Experience Testing**
1. **UI/UX Validation**
   - Test responsive design
   - Test accessibility features
   - Test error handling
   - Test loading states

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All 4 must-have features working end-to-end
- [ ] No critical errors in user workflows
- [ ] Performance acceptable for MVP
- [ ] User experience intuitive and smooth

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Test video processing pipeline
2. **Short-term**: Test email delivery system
3. **Medium-term**: Complete end-to-end testing
4. **Long-term**: Performance optimization and user testing
