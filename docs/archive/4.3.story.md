## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 4.2 (Frontend-Backend Integration):
- Backend running on port 3001, frontend on port 3000 with proxy configuration
- CORS properly configured for frontend-backend communication
- Authentication flow working between frontend and backend
- API proxy configured in Vite with `/api` prefix rewriting to backend endpoints

### Current System Context
- **Backend**: NestJS API with channels endpoints already implemented
  - `GET /channels` - List user's YouTube subscriptions
  - `GET /channels/selected` - Get user's selected channels for digests
  - `POST /channels/select` - Save channel selection (limit 10)
- **Frontend**: React + Vite with ChannelManagement component (currently using mock data)
- **Integration Issue**: Frontend channel management not connected to real backend API

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: NestJS, TypeScript, Prisma ORM, Google OAuth
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Ant Design, React Query
- **API Integration**: RESTful API with CORS-enabled endpoints

### Data Models
[Source: architecture.md#data-model]
- `user(id, email, tz, created_at)`
- `channel_subscription(user_id, channel_id, title, selected_at)`

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture.md#api-design]
- **Channels Endpoints**:
  - `GET /channels` - List user subscriptions (requires OAuth)
  - `POST /channels/select {channelIds: string[]; titles?: Record<string, string>}` - Save selection (limit 10)
  - `GET /channels/selected` - Get current selection

### Component Specifications
[Source: frontend/src/pages/ChannelManagement.tsx]
- **ChannelManagement Component**: Main page for channel management
- **Interface**: Table with channel list, search, and action buttons
- **State Management**: React Query for data fetching and caching
- **UI Framework**: Ant Design components (Table, Button, Input, Modal)

### File Locations
- **Backend API**: `src/modules/channels/channels.controller.ts`, `src/modules/channels/channels.service.ts`
- **Frontend Components**: `frontend/src/pages/ChannelManagement.tsx`
- **Frontend Hooks**: `frontend/src/hooks/useChannels.ts`
- **API Configuration**: `frontend/vite.config.ts` (proxy settings)

### Integration Points
- **Authentication**: Uses existing OAuth flow for YouTube API access
- **Data Loading**: React Query for caching and state management
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and user feedback
- **State Synchronization**: Real-time updates between frontend and backend

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]
- **Unit Tests**: Services (channels), adapters (mock providers)
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end channel selection flow
- **API Tests**: Endpoint contracts and auth flows
- **Frontend Tests**: Component rendering and user interactions

### Technical Constraints
- **Channel Limit**: Maximum 10 channels per user (enforced in backend)
- **OAuth Required**: YouTube API access requires valid OAuth tokens
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for API failures
- **Performance**: React Query caching for optimal user experience

### Security Considerations
[Source: architecture.md#security]
- **OAuth Scopes**: YouTube read-only where possible
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-user for mutation endpoints
- **Token Storage**: Encrypted storage of OAuth tokens
- **API Security**: Maintain existing security headers and authentication

### Risk Assessment
- **Primary Risk**: OAuth token expiration causing API failures
- **Mitigation**: Proper error handling and token refresh logic
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation with user feedback
- **Testing**: Comprehensive error scenario testing

## Definition of Done
- [x] Frontend channel management successfully connects to backend API
- [x] Users can view and select channels through the web interface
- [x] Channel selection is properly persisted and synchronized
- [x] All error scenarios are handled gracefully
- [x] Loading states and user feedback implemented
- [x] Channel management follows existing UI/UX patterns
- [x] Comprehensive tests cover all functionality
- [x] Documentation updated with integration details
- [x] Security patterns maintained throughout
