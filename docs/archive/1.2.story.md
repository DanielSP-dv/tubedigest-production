# Story 1.2 — Channel selection (limit 10) and cadence preference

## Status: Done

## Story
As a user,
I want to view my YouTube channel subscriptions and select up to 10 channels for my digest,
so that I only receive summaries from the sources I care about and at my preferred cadence.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `GET /channels` returns the connected account's subscriptions (channelId, title, thumbnail) or a clear error if not connected
2. `POST /channels/select { channelIds: string[] }` persists the selection
   - If more than 10 provided → 400 with message "limit_exceeded"
3. `GET /channels/selected` returns the user's current selection
4. User can set digest cadence to daily or weekly and confirm timezone (reuse `/me` or a new endpoint)
5. Errors from YouTube API (quota/network) are logged and surfaced as friendly messages; retries follow backoff policy
6. All endpoints are authenticated to the connected user context

## Dev Notes (from Architecture)
- Modules: `channels` (list/select), `jobs` for future runs
  - [Source: architecture/modules-nestjs.md]
- Quotas & caching for YouTube subscription listing
  - [Source: architecture/rate-limiting-caching.md]
- Per-user processing budgets/priorities (future epics)
  - [Source: architecture/performance-prioritization.md]

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Data model
  - [x] Add Prisma model `ChannelSubscription(userId, channelId, title, selectedAt)` and migrate
  - [x] (Optional) extend `User` with `tz`, `cadence` if not already persisted in DB
- [x] Channels module (NestJS)
  - [x] Controller/Service skeleton
  - [x] `GET /channels` → call YouTube Data API (Subscriptions:list) using stored tokens; map to DTO
  - [x] `POST /channels/select` → validate ≤10; upsert selected channels; remove deselected
  - [x] `GET /channels/selected` → return persisted selection
- [x] Preferences
  - [x] Reuse `/me` or add endpoint to set `cadence` (daily|weekly) and confirm `tz`
- [x] Validation & errors
  - [x] Enforce max 10 channels; return 400 with clear message
  - [x] Handle YouTube API errors; log and return user-friendly messages
- [x] Tests
  - [x] Unit tests for selection validation (≤10)
  - [x] Integration tests for persistence of selection and retrieval

## Testing
- [x] Given >10 channelIds in POST, API returns 400 and does not persist changes
- [x] Given valid ≤10 channelIds, selection is saved and `GET /channels/selected` returns the same set
- [x] `GET /channels` responds 200 with list when tokens valid; responds with clear error when no connection

## Constraints
- Max 10 selected channels per user
- Respect YouTube quota limits and backoff guidance

## File List (to be maintained by Dev)
- (Dev to populate with created/modified files)

## Dev Agent Record (Dev‑only to update)
- Agent Model Used: Claude Sonnet 4
- Debug Log References: QA testing session - channel selection functionality verified
- Completion Notes: Channel selection functionality fully implemented with proper validation, persistence, and error handling. All acceptance criteria met.
- Change Log: Status → Done; all tasks completed and tested
