# Story 2.2 — Video retrieval and transcript processing

## Status: Done

## Story
As a system,
I want to automatically fetch new videos from subscribed YouTube channels and process their transcripts to generate summaries and chapters,
so that users receive rich, informative digest content with AI-generated insights and structured timestamps.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. System automatically fetches new videos from user's subscribed channels via YouTube Data API
2. Video metadata (title, URL, duration, published date) is stored in database
3. Video transcripts are retrieved and processed to generate AI summaries
4. Chapter timestamps and titles are extracted from video metadata or transcript analysis
5. Processing is done asynchronously via background jobs to avoid blocking user requests
6. Failed video processing is retried with exponential backoff
7. System handles YouTube API rate limits gracefully
8. Video processing status is tracked and logged for monitoring

## Dev Notes (from Architecture)
- YouTube Data API integration for video fetching
- Transcript processing via YouTube's auto-captions or manual captions
- AI summary generation using GPT-4 or similar model
- Background job processing via BullMQ queue
- Rate limiting and error handling for external APIs
- Database models: Video, Summary, Chapter (already implemented)

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Created VideosService with mock video generation
  - [x] Integrated with DigestsService for video fetching
  - [x] Database models for Video, Summary, Chapter (from Story 2.1)
- [x] Transcript processing framework
  - [x] Mock transcript processing with AI summaries
  - [x] Chapter extraction with timestamps
  - [x] Database storage for summaries and chapters
- [x] Background job integration
  - [x] VideosService integrated with existing job queue
  - [x] Async processing for video fetching and transcript analysis
- [x] YouTube Data API integration
  - [x] Replace mock video generation with real API calls
  - [x] Implement channel video fetching with pagination
  - [x] Handle YouTube API rate limits and quotas
- [x] Real transcript processing
  - [x] YouTube transcript/caption retrieval
  - [x] AI model integration for summary generation
  - [x] Chapter detection from video metadata or transcript analysis
- [x] Error handling and monitoring
  - [x] Retry logic for failed video processing
  - [x] Rate limit handling and backoff strategies
  - [x] Processing status tracking and logging

## Testing
- [x] Mock video generation creates realistic test data
- [x] Video processing creates summaries and chapters
- [x] Integration with digest assembly works correctly
- [x] YouTube API integration handles rate limits gracefully
- [x] Transcript processing generates accurate summaries
- [x] Chapter extraction provides useful timestamps
- [x] Background job processing handles failures and retries

## Constraints
- Respect YouTube Data API quotas (10,000 units/day)
- Process videos asynchronously to avoid blocking user requests
- Handle missing transcripts gracefully (some videos may not have captions)
- AI processing should be cost-effective and respect usage limits
