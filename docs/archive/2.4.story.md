# Story 2.4 — Authentication Integration Fix - Brownfield Addition

## Status: Draft

## Story
As a **user of TubeDigest**,
I want **to be able to sign in and access my video digests**,
So that **I can view my personalized video content through the web interface**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing NestJS backend authentication system and React frontend
- Technology: Google OAuth, JWT tokens, React Query, Ant Design
- Follows pattern: Existing auth flow with `/auth/google` endpoint and `/me` verification
- Touch points: Frontend auth service, backend auth guard, videos controller

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. User can successfully authenticate via Google OAuth
2. Frontend properly handles authentication state and stores tokens
3. Authenticated requests to `/videos/digest` endpoint work correctly
4. Unauthenticated users see appropriate sign-in prompts

**Integration Requirements:**
5. Existing `/auth/google` endpoint continues to work unchanged
6. New authentication flow follows existing JWT pattern
7. Integration with videos controller maintains current behavior
8. Frontend auth service properly integrates with existing backend auth

**Quality Requirements:**
9. Authentication flow is covered by appropriate tests
10. Error handling for auth failures is implemented
11. No regression in existing functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Connect frontend auth service to existing backend OAuth flow, ensure proper token handling and API request authentication
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow existing JWT authentication pattern used in backend auth guard
- **Key Constraints:** Must work with existing Google OAuth setup and maintain current security standards

## Definition of Done

- [ ] User can sign in via Google OAuth
- [ ] Frontend properly manages authentication state
- [ ] `/videos/digest` endpoint returns data for authenticated users
- [ ] Unauthenticated users see sign-in prompts
- [ ] Error handling for auth failures works correctly
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Breaking existing authentication flow
- **Mitigation:** Test existing auth endpoints before and after changes
- **Rollback:** Revert to previous auth service implementation if needed

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing auth APIs
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible

## Scope Validation

- [x] Story can be completed in one development session
- [x] Integration approach is straightforward
- [x] Follows existing patterns exactly
- [x] No design or architecture work required

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Story 2.3 completed frontend implementation but authentication integration is missing
- Backend has working OAuth and JWT authentication system
- Frontend auth service exists but needs proper integration with backend
- `/videos/digest` endpoint requires authentication but frontend is not authenticated

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18+ + Ant Design 5.x + TypeScript
- **Backend**: NestJS with JWT authentication
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth with JWT tokens
- **State Management**: React Query for API state

### File Locations
- `frontend/src/services/auth.ts` - Frontend authentication service (VERIFIED: exists with OAuth redirect and /me endpoint integration)
- `src/modules/auth/` - Backend authentication module (VERIFIED: contains auth.service.ts, auth.guard.ts, auth.middleware.ts)
- `src/modules/videos/videos.controller.ts` - Videos endpoint with auth guard (VERIFIED: requires authentication)
- `frontend/src/hooks/useDigests.ts` - API hook that needs authentication

### Authentication Implementation Details (VERIFIED)
- **Backend OAuth Flow**: 
  - `/auth/google` endpoint generates OAuth URL with YouTube read-only scope
  - OAuth callback exchanges code for tokens and stores encrypted in database
  - Uses AES-256-GCM encryption for token storage
  - Session-based authentication with cookies
- **Frontend Auth Service**:
  - Singleton pattern with React hook integration
  - OAuth redirect to backend endpoint
  - `/me` endpoint verification for authentication status
  - State management with listener pattern
- **Auth Guard**: 
  - Protects `/videos/digest` endpoint
  - Requires valid session or user email in headers/cookies
  - Throws UnauthorizedException for unauthenticated requests

### Testing Standards
- **Test Framework**: Vitest + React Testing Library (VERIFIED: configured in frontend)
- **Test File Location**: `frontend/src/**/__tests__/` (VERIFIED: existing pattern)
- **Test Setup**: `frontend/src/test/setup.ts` with mocks for IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver, and window.matchMedia
- **Authentication Testing Patterns**:
  - Mock auth service responses
  - Test OAuth redirect flows
  - Verify authentication state changes
  - Test protected API endpoint access
  - Mock fetch responses for /me endpoint
- **API Integration Testing**:
  - Mock React Query responses
  - Test error handling for 401 responses
  - Verify authentication headers in requests
  - Test retry logic for auth failures

### Security Considerations
- **Token Storage**: Backend encrypts OAuth tokens using AES-256-GCM
- **Session Management**: Uses secure session cookies for authentication
- **OAuth Scopes**: Limited to YouTube read-only access
- **API Security**: Protected endpoints require valid authentication
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive information exposed in error messages
- **CORS**: Properly configured for frontend-backend communication
