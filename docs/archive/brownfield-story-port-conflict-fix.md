# **Port Configuration & Backend API Fix - Brownfield Story**

## **Story Title**

Backend API Endpoint Resolution & Port Configuration Fix - Brownfield Addition

## **User Story**

As a **developer**,
I want **the backend to serve API responses instead of frontend HTML content**,
So that **the frontend can properly communicate with the backend API and authentication flow works correctly**.

## **Story Context**

**Existing System Integration:**
- **Integrates with**: Frontend React application, authentication service, API proxy configuration
- **Technology**: NestJS backend, React frontend, Vite dev server, proxy configuration
- **Follows pattern**: Standard frontend-backend separation with API proxy

**Current Problem:**
- Backend (port 3001) is serving frontend HTML instead of API responses
- Frontend authentication service is stuck in loading state
- API endpoints return HTML content instead of JSON
- Port configuration conflicts between frontend and backend

## **Acceptance Criteria**

### **Functional Requirements**
- [ ] Backend API endpoints return proper JSON responses
- [ ] Frontend authentication service can successfully call `/api/me` endpoint
- [ ] Health endpoint returns JSON health status
- [ ] All API endpoints respond with correct content type
- [ ] Frontend can successfully authenticate and navigate to dashboard

### **Technical Requirements**
- [ ] Backend serves only API responses on port 3001
- [ ] Frontend serves only UI content on port 3000
- [ ] Vite proxy configuration works correctly
- [ ] No static file serving conflicts between frontend and backend
- [ ] Authentication flow completes successfully

### **Quality Requirements**
- [ ] No port conflicts between services
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns between frontend and backend
- [ ] Maintains existing API contract
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality

## **Technical Approach**

### **Root Cause Analysis**
1. **Static File Serving**: Backend may be configured to serve frontend build files
2. **Catch-all Routes**: Backend may have catch-all routes serving frontend content
3. **Middleware Configuration**: Static file middleware may be overriding API routes
4. **Build Configuration**: Frontend build may be incorrectly deployed to backend

### **Solution Strategy**
1. **Audit Backend Configuration**: Remove any static file serving middleware
2. **Verify API Routes**: Ensure all API endpoints are properly configured
3. **Test API Endpoints**: Verify each endpoint returns correct JSON responses
4. **Fix Authentication Flow**: Ensure `/api/me` endpoint works correctly
5. **Validate Port Configuration**: Confirm proper separation between frontend and backend

## **Implementation Tasks**

### **Task 1: Audit Backend Static File Configuration**
- [ ] Search for static file serving middleware
- [ ] Remove any static file serving configuration
- [ ] Verify backend only serves API responses

### **Task 2: Test API Endpoints**
- [ ] Test `/health` endpoint returns JSON
- [ ] Test `/api/me` endpoint returns JSON
- [ ] Test all other API endpoints
- [ ] Verify content-type headers

### **Task 3: Fix Authentication Flow**
- [ ] Ensure `/api/me` endpoint works correctly
- [ ] Test authentication service integration
- [ ] Verify login/logout flow
- [ ] Test protected route access

### **Task 4: Validate Port Configuration**
- [ ] Confirm backend runs on port 3001
- [ ] Confirm frontend runs on port 3000
- [ ] Test Vite proxy configuration
- [ ] Verify no port conflicts

### **Task 5: Integration Testing**
- [ ] Test complete authentication flow
- [ ] Test frontend-backend communication
- [ ] Verify all features work correctly
- [ ] Test error handling

## **Definition of Done**

### **Code Quality**
- [ ] All API endpoints return proper JSON responses
- [ ] No static file serving conflicts
- [ ] Proper separation between frontend and backend
- [ ] Clean port configuration

### **Testing**
- [ ] All API endpoints tested and working
- [ ] Authentication flow tested end-to-end
- [ ] Frontend-backend integration tested
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

### **Documentation**
- [ ] Port configuration documented
- [ ] API endpoint behavior documented
- [ ] Authentication flow documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide updated

## **Risk Assessment**

### **Low Risk**
- **Scope**: Focused fix to existing configuration
- **Impact**: No breaking changes to API contract
- **Testing**: Can be tested incrementally

### **Mitigation**
- **Incremental Testing**: Test each endpoint individually
- **Rollback Plan**: Can revert configuration changes
- **Monitoring**: Monitor authentication flow during testing

## **Success Metrics**

### **Functional Metrics**
- [ ] Authentication flow completes successfully
- [ ] All API endpoints return correct responses
- [ ] Frontend can access protected routes
- [ ] No blank pages or loading issues

### **Technical Metrics**
- [ ] Backend serves only API content on port 3001
- [ ] Frontend serves only UI content on port 3000
- [ ] No port conflicts between services
- [ ] Proper content-type headers on all responses
