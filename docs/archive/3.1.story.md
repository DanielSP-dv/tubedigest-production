# Story 3.1: Video Discovery & Ingestion Pipeline

## Status: DONE ✅

## Story
As a system administrator, I want a robust video discovery and ingestion pipeline that automatically fetches new videos from YouTube channels, so that users can receive timely digests of their subscribed content.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Fetch videos from YouTube Data API using OAuth tokens
- [x] Implement fallback to API key when OAuth fails
- [x] Support multiple video formats and metadata extraction
- [x] Handle API rate limits and quota management
- [x] Process videos in background queues with retry logic
- [x] Store video metadata in database with proper indexing
- [x] Support configurable time windows for video discovery
- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling and logging

## Tasks/Subtasks
- [x] Create YouTube API service with OAuth integration
- [x] Implement fallback mechanisms for API failures
- [x] Add video metadata extraction and validation
- [x] Create database schema for video storage
- [x] Implement queue processing with BullMQ
- [x] Add rate limiting and quota management
- [x] Create comprehensive error handling
- [x] Write extensive tests
- [x] QA Review completed ✅

## ⚠️ **REQUIRED COMPLETION ITEMS**

### **Video Processing Pipeline**
- [x] YouTube API integration working with OAuth and fallback
- [x] Video metadata extraction and storage functioning
- [x] Queue processing with BullMQ working efficiently
- [ ] **Test real transcript processing** with AI service
- [ ] **Verify AI integration** is working for new videos
- [ ] **Update existing videos** with real AI summaries

### **Real Data Integration**
- [ ] Test complete pipeline with real YouTube transcripts
- [ ] Verify AI summaries are generated for new videos
- [ ] Verify chapters are extracted with real timestamps
- [ ] Test error handling for AI service failures

### **Production Readiness**
- [ ] Configure AI service rate limiting
- [ ] Test pipeline with various video types and lengths
- [ ] Validate cost management for AI processing
- [ ] Test fallback mechanisms when AI fails

**Note**: Story marked as "IN PROGRESS" because video ingestion is working but transcript processing with real AI needs verification and testing.
