## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 4.3 (Channel Management Integration):
- Backend running on port 3001, frontend on port 3000 with proxy configuration
- CORS properly configured for frontend-backend communication
- Authentication flow working between frontend and backend
- API proxy configured in Vite with `/api` prefix rewriting to backend endpoints
- Existing OAuth flow uses Google OAuth with session cookies
- AuthGuard implemented for protected endpoints

### Technology Stack
[Source: docs/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend**: React 18+, TypeScript, Vite, Ant Design 5.x
- **Backend**: NestJS, TypeScript, Postgres, Redis
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth with session cookies
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library

### Component Architecture
[Source: docs/frontend-backend-architecture.md]
- **Project Structure**: `frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx`
- **UI Framework**: Ant Design 5.x with TypeScript
- **Component Pattern**: Functional components with hooks
- **Styling**: CSS Modules + Ant Design tokens
- **State Management**: React Query + Zustand

### API Specifications
[Source: docs/architecture/api-design-rest-nestjs.md]
- **OAuth Endpoints**:
  - `GET /auth/google` - Redirect to Google OAuth
  - `GET /auth/google/callback` - Handle OAuth callback, store tokens
  - `GET /me` - Get current user profile
- **Integration**: Existing OAuth flow must remain unchanged

### File Locations
- **Landing Page**: `frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx`
- **Routing**: `frontend/src/App.tsx` (React Router configuration)
- **Authentication Service**: `frontend/src/services/auth.ts`

- **Styles**: `frontend/src/styles/landing.css`

### Integration Points
- **OAuth Flow**: Integrate with existing Google OAuth implementation
- **Routing**: React Router v6 for navigation
- **Authentication State**: Use existing auth hooks and services
- **Performance**: Vite bundling and optimization

### Technical Constraints
- **Performance**: Landing page must load in under 2 seconds
- **Compatibility**: Must work with existing OAuth flow without modification
- **Responsive Design**: Must be mobile-responsive using Ant Design
- **Accessibility**: Follow Ant Design accessibility guidelines

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Unit Tests**: Component testing with Jest + React Testing Library
- **Integration Tests**: OAuth flow testing with supertest
- **Performance Tests**: Page load time verification
- **Mobile Testing**: Responsive design testing across screen sizes

## Testing
- **Test File Location**: `frontend/src/pages/__tests__/LandingPage.test.tsx`
- **Test Standards**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Testing Frameworks**: Unit tests for component rendering and interactions
- **Specific Requirements**: 
  - Test OAuth button functionality
  - Test mobile responsiveness
  - Test page load performance
  - Test routing integration
