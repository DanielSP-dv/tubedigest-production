## Background Context
Currently, users can access different parts of the application without clear authentication state, leading to confusion and poor user experience. The recent authentication flow fixes resolved security issues but highlighted the need for a complete UX overhaul. Users need a clear path from landing page through authentication to channel selection and finally to the dashboard, with persistent sessions that maintain their state.
